                    <h1><b>The Elf.</b></h1>
                    <p>The original idea for this project involved upgrading an old light that my dad really liked. It had been
                        in the family for a while, probably since they were originally made, which like in the 70s or something.
                        So yeah, it was pretty old school. In this post I'll go over my plan based on the first time my dad got
                        it upgraded, the steps I took to get started, what I've got working at the time of this post, what I'd do different,
                        and my plans for continuing in the immediate future.</p>

                        <h4><b>The New Ring</b></h4>
                        <p>The original elf came with injection molded ring to hold all the lights.
                            and with this being a 3D printing class (along with all the hotglue from the first upgrade)
                            a new version of the ring was in order. So I made the model above in OpenScad. </p>

                        <p>For the first upgrade, the old school electrical engineering magic was replaced with an Arduino.
                            This worked well for the most part. But it's 2018 so I wanted to be able to do some sweet wireless nonsense.
                            So I decided on an Adafruit nRF52 Bluetooth feather microcontroller. This will alow for bluetooth control of colors,
                            brightness, and possibly change or add patterns.</p>

                        <h4><b>The New LEDs</b></h4>
                        <p>The first time the ring was updated, single color LEDs that were controlled by digital output pins,
                            meaning that in addition to not being able to control brightness or color, they were grouped together in sets of 5.
                            This limited the amout of possible options for patterns. To solve these problems, I found Adafruit NeoPixels, pictured above,
                            are RGB LEDs that have control chips, which allows them to be chained together using only one data pin. This means that I can
                            actually fit the amount of wires I need to connect 30 of the lights around the ring.</p>

                        <p>All things considered, the first print turned out really well. My first ever 3D print and nothing broke, the support material worked well,
                            the only problems came from my guestimated measurements. The star was thicker than needed, and the holes for the lights were too big.</p>

                        <p>On the second try, I got the mounts the right size, and had the bright idea of including a hook to hang it, and some standoffs on the back of the star.
                            You can't see them in this picture, but don't worry, they didn't print right. This was probably the worst print of the bunch, but I learned a lot from it.
                            Like for one, I should have used slic3r instead of cura, and that I should probably print in two parts to save time and so the standoffs don't wind up 
                            enveloped in the support material for the star.</p>

                        <p>For the third print I finally realized that I should print in two pieces, which I did, and as a result got done with both of those prints in about 
                            half the time it would have taken if I did it as one piece. Unfortunately, I found out after I sat down to finish up and solder all the lights into place
                            that I had never actually counted how many holders I needed. I guess I had seen "31 Lights!" on a box in my initial research and forgot that the elf had a 
                            bulb behind him. Needless to say, I was frustrated, but at least I knew that my new printing method wouldn't take 8 hours this time.</p>

                            on that front.</p>

                        <p>Back in the day, they didn't have LEDs, so the original elf had some old school hardware based magic to make the lights spin around. 
                            The only problem with that these days is replacement bulbs where increadibly hard to find.</p>

                        <p>In the first upgrade, as mentioned before, single color LEDs were used. This was pretty much fine, as it allowed the emulation of the original pattern of blinking
                            and could drop right into the original light holders without any modification because it was just two pins. But, it wasn't as cool as RGB could make it.</p>

                        <h4><b>The NeoPixel</b></h4>
                        <p>This is where the neopixels come in, as they can be linked together using only one data pin, they make it really easy to use way less wire than regular RGB would be.
                            The only problem was that they had 4 pins instead of two (althought this would have been a problem with regular RGB LEDs anyway). To get around this I had to snip
                            the part of the light holder that would sink into the ring and separate the two pins off, and then use a soldering iron to melt out a larger slot for all 4 pins to fit through.
                            For some of the early attempts, I stripped some wire and put that over the pins, as seen above. This worked, but seemed a bit wasteful and like something I could just work around
                            with some hotglue and a bigger hole. Seen below is an attempt to mount a couple of these new fitted pixels to a breadboard and see how they look. I didn't use enough hotglue so they
                            didn't stick great, but it'll be enough glue to hold them together when I finally get around to soldering.
