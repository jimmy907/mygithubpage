                    <p>The original idea for this project involved upgrading an old light that my dad really liked. It had been
                        in the family for a while, probably since they were originally made, which like in the 70s or something.
                        So yeah, it was pretty old school. In this post I'll go over my plan based on the first time my dad got
                        it upgraded, the steps I took to get started, what I've got working at the time of this post, what I'd do different,
                        and my plans for continuing in the immediate future.</p>
